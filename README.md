# DTSPLDFSSFoam
A density-based compressible flow solver in OpenFOAM with dual time-stepping, low Mach number preconditioning and Low-Diffusion Flux Splitting Scheme. Works as usual with dynamic mesh too.

#### Compiles with OpenFOAM-7 or later and OpenFOAM-v2106 or later. Compilation with earlier versions may require changing a few included header filenames and Make/option file.
